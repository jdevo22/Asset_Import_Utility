Asset Import Utility Version 1.1.0


// Latest

Version 1.1.0 changes how zip files are selected, switching from folder to individual file search. Folder search has been deprecated but will likely be re-implemented in a later release. 
The .blend file type has been disabled due to not being processed correctly and will be re-enabled once compatibility has been fixed. 

// Overview
