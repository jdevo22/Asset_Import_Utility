# Asset_Import_Utility
Simple Python script to unzip, rename, and move files into Unity projects.

1.0 Currently only works with .fbx and .dae object files.

This script extracts all zipped folders in the specified path, renames textures files to the corresponding object, and moves all object files into an 'Imported Assets' folder and all texture files into a separate 'Textures' subfolder within the specified Unity project folder.
